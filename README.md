# Stack Overflow

A solo, turn-based roguelite card-puzzle game built with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) in C. Play traditional cards onto a 3x3 "Memory Grid" to trigger scoring alignments, all while keeping the grid's total value under the **Stack Limit** — go over, and it's a `FATAL ERROR: Stack Overflow` crash.

The whole game leans into a dark "code editor" aesthetic: monospace HUD, terminal-styled crash messages, and a shop full of programming-flavored upgrades (Wildcard, Buffer Reload, Garbage Collector, Segfault Handler...).

## Gameplay

- A standard 52-card deck is shuffled each round; the 3x3 grid starts filled with 9 cards, and your hand holds 4.
- Play a card from your hand onto a free (unlocked) cell of the grid.
- Face cards trigger special effects when placed:
  - **Ace** — flexes between 1 and 11 to help you stay under the limit.
  - **Jack** — swap two cards on the grid.
  - **Queen** — absorb the value of adjacent cards and lock the cell.
  - **King** — optionally flip row/column detection to read diagonals as lines.
- Matching 3 cards in a row, column, or diagonal (same suit, straight, three-of-a-kind, or straight flush) scores points and clears/refills those cells.
- After each move, the grid's total value is checked against the round's Stack Limit — exceed it and the run ends.
- Clear each round's score objective to advance, earn gold, and spend it in the shop between rounds on one-shot Scripts and permanent Modules.
